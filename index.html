  <p class="paragraph">Hi! This website was a piece of work set for ict , the objective was to create a webpage not just a website.
  There was virtually only one rule , and that was that our webpage had to be related to it/ tech. At the time of wrighting this i had just recently swapped my sister old Iphone 4s for a ipod 6th gen that ha a bad battery and a bad screen , i was planning to repair it and at the same moment i was getting requests to fix their broken phones or build a monitor . Because of this when we were asigned this project my mind instantly went to repairing/ making tech and so this webpage was born. </p>
