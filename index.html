  <h1 class="heading1">Welcome!</h1>
  <p class="paragraph">Hi! This website was a piece of work set for ict , the objective was to create a webpage not just a website.
  There was virtually only one rule , and that was that our webpage had to be related to it/ tech. At the time of wrighting this i had just recently swapped my sister old Iphone 4s for a ipod 6th gen that ha a bad battery and a bad screen , i was planning to repair it and at the same moment i was getting requests to fix their broken phones or build a monitor . Because of this when we were asigned this project my mind instantly went to repairing/ making tech and so this webpage was born. </p>
  <h1 class="heading1">How much does it cost?</h1>
  <p class="paragraph"> it all depends on the price of components , if its software related it shoulnd be costly (max 5eur).</p>
  <h1 class="heading1">how i repair phones.</h1>
  <p class="paragraph">What i will usualy do i get a request for a certain device (eg: One plus 3t). I will the quickly look up the prices for the replacement parts and tell the customer how much it would cost, then i will look at a disasembly video and see how dificult it will be to take apart and replace the broken part. then i wait and wait and wait for the parts to arrive (it take a long time because the parts usually come from china). After that i will turn the phone on and test if everything still works , then ill put the phone back together and mess with it for a bit (now that i can ) and ill give it back the next time i meet the customer (thats why i dont send phones out/take phones in).  </p>
<h>where do i get my parts from?</h>
