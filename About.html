var txt = 'Hello! I am an 14 year old boy that loves making/fixing stuff. Examples of my making/fixing stuff would bee this website! (you can read more about that on the homepage). Id say that the reason that I actually enjoy this and have pursued it is because of my grandfather , when I was younger I had an rc car but the antenna had broken so I asked my grandpa to fix it but what he did was instead of just fixing it and giving it to me  , he decided to buy me a soldering iron and taught me how to solder (that rc car still works to this day (even in the hands of my little brother)). But hey I also like to make stuff, so what do I make? Well I annually make some sort of wooden gift for a relatives birthday, so far ive made at least 2 boxes and a wooden cake knife (the cake knife was by far the easiest), ive also built an pc with my friend for my friend (I might be a bit jealous of it).  Well that’s something about me, thank for visiting the website and considering me as you it technician!';
